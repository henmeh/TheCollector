![plot](./images/thecollector.png)

The Collector is a Website to create, sell and starting auctions for NFTs. Everytime the user mints or buys an NFT on the side he/she will get some ERC20 CollectorToken as reward.

The Smart Contracts for the marketplace, the nft and the reward are alle deployed on Ropsten testnet.
